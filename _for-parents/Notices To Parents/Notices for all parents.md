<p>Jurong West Primary School communicates with parents through the Parents
Gateway application. For any clarifications, parents can call the general
office (67933419) or email us at <a href="mailto:jwsc2@ymca.edu.sg" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">jwps@moe.edu.sg</a>
</p>
<p>Teachers are allowed to use their preferred mode of communications with
parents (Parents Gateway app, Whatsapp, phone calls, Student handbook etc).
We respect the privacy of the teachers and teachers are not required give
their handphone numbers to parents.</p>
<p>Unless it is an emergency (student forgot some information is not an emergency),
we sincerely hope that parents do not contact teachers during weekends,
school holidays, and from 7pm to 8am on school days.</p>
<p>Teachers and general office staff will typically respond to parents' queries
within 3 working days. For more complicated matters, we will provide an
interim update within 3 working days. We will update parents soonest possible
after we have conducted a detailed investigation.</p>

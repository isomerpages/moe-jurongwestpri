The PAM department aims to provide students with skills, knowledge and attitudes necessary to make active living a way of life.  
  
We have programmes incorporating a wide range of experiences that are organised to meet the needs and interests of all students. The instructional component is the main focus of the physical education programme with the co-curricular activities (CCA), special events, Health and Fitness Club (HFC) and leadership programme being important and related components of the overall programme. 

Our goals:

1. Every student will leave our programme with the basic skill development and fitness level that is required to participate in a variety of healthy lifestyle, recreational, or competitive actvities.
2. All students will gain an appreciation and understanding of the importance of making good lifestyle choices.
3. Develop a strong and positive relationship with the parents and community to help them better understand, appreciate, and encourage positive lifestyle choices in their families and community around them.

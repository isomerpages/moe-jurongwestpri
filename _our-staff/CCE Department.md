Our CCE efforts focused on achieving common desired outcomes namely the school’s vision, mission and THInKER values. The school hopes to provide a student-centred and values driven education, in line with the CCE Learning Outcomes.

In the conceptualisation and implementation of the CCE programmes in JWPS, the school takes into consideration the inculcation of the RICH values and the school core values (THInKER; Teamwork, Honesty, Innovativeness, Kindness, Enthusiasm and Resilience).

We hope that the carefully planned and customised programmes will develop our students’ character and develop their 21st century competencies as well as Social and Emotional (SE) competencies. These values are fundamental in building the character and citizenship education of our students. 

Moving forward, we will be tweaking our existing programmes to achieve the **CCE 2021 goals.**

The school hopes to provide a student-centred and values driven education, in line with the CCE Learning Outcomes. <br></p><p>In the conceptualisation and implementation of the CCE programmes in JWPS, the school takes into consideration the inculcation of the RICH values and the school core values (THInKER; Teamwork, Honesty, Innovativeness, Kindness, Enthusiasm and Resilience). <br></p><p>We hope that the carefully planned and customised programmes will develop our students’ character and develop their 21st&nbsp;century competencies as well as Social and Emotional (SE) competencies. These values are fundamental in building the character and citizenship education of our students.&nbsp; <br></p><p>Moving forward, we will be tweaking our existing programmes to achieve the&nbsp;<strong>CCE 2021 goals.</strong></p><div class="isomer-image-wrapper"><img height="auto" width="100%" alt="CCE" src="/images/CCE%20Front.png"></div><p><br></p><p>For more information about CCE programmes and activities in JWPS:</p><p><a href="/CCEprog" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">CCE Programmes</a></p>

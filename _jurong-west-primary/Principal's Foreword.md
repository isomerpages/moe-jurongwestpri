Dear Parents and Partners,

2022 is a turning point for all Singaporeans as we emerged from the thick of the pandemic and tried to establish normalcy in the new environment. The resumption of activities posed some challenges to us in JWPS as we tried to balance between how much our manpower could allow us to resume programmes. Nevertheless, we were determined to enhance the schooling experience of our students, even if that meant stretching the limits of our teachers’ time and energy. For this, I applaud the JWPS team for their grit and resilience.

After 4 years of planning and preparation, we opened MK@JWPS in Jan 2022 and welcomed 4 classes of K1 students in both sessions. This ‘expansion’ of the school brought much joy and excitement not only to the MK wing but also excitement to our Primary School wing. This year, we collaboration on numerous celebrations and activities; adhering to our vision to create a seamless learning experience from K1 to P6 for our neighbourhood kids. In 2023, we look forward to MK@JWPS reaching full capacity as we will operate both K1 and K2 levels.

Uncertainty might still have engulfed many as the PSLE AL system moved to its second year. At JWPS, we have long embraced this change and adjusted our teaching and learning to focus on skills and values and not just on outcome. We know that outcomes are natural occurrences to well-learned skills and attitudes. Thus, we have reduced emphasis on drills and exposed students to independent learning through BYOD, Project Inno, ALP and Project YEE. We have strong conviction that our students going through these programmes will turn into strong independent learners and positive outcomes will follow. The P6 cohort of 2022 has proven our belief right. The cohort attained a best-ever progression to Express rate of 70.9%, with 10% attaining 9 AL points or better and 100% passes for our Standard stream. This is testimonial to the resilient of this cohort and the teachers who had had their learning disrupted since they were in P3. We are confident that we are on the right track to lead future cohorts out of COVID and towards excellence.

We look forward to 2023 as we continue to offer a full experience of learning to all our kids at JWPS. We will continue to enhance both the physical environment and quality of our programmes and continue to be the ‘trusted’ JWPS that many in the neighbourhood have known us to be.

We will work with you, hand in hand, to walk alongside your child towards the same goal: A Learner ; A THInKER ; A Leader

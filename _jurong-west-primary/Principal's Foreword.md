<p>It is my privilege to take on my appointment as the 4th Principal of Jurong
West Primary School. The school has certainly grown from strength to strength,
and I would like to express my appreciation to the school leaders and staff
– past and present – who have contributed to the school’s development over
the years.</p>
<p>At Jurong West Primary School, we believe in fostering an environment
where every JWPS student is encouraged to explore their potential, pursue
their passions, and develop into well-rounded individuals, ready to face
the challenges of the future. Our dedicated team of staff is committed
to providing an engaging and inclusive learning experience that goes beyond
the classroom, preparing our JWPS students to be Confident Persons, Active
Contributors, Concerned Citizens and Conscientious Learners.</p>
<p>This academic year promises to be filled with exciting opportunities,
meaningful learning experiences, and memorable moments. We will continue
to focus on providing the students with holistic education through a whole
suite of programmes that support their cognitive development, acquisition
of the 21CC and leadership development, to nurture every JWPS student into
becoming an Engaged Learner, a Reflective THInKER and a Selfless Leader.</p>
<p>With the school’s strong culture of care, commitment of staff as well
as the strong support of the School Advisory Committee, Parents, Alumni
and sustained partnerships with the community, we are confident that Jurong
West Primary School will be a place where every JWPS student can thrive
and reach their full potential. Together, we will create an environment
that enables our JWPS students to Think and Grow!</p>

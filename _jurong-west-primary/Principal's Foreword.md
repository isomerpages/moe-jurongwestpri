Dear Parents,  

2020 and 2021 have been challenging years to all Singaporeans with the numerous disruptions caused by Covid-19.  JWPS had our fair share of challenging times, but I am glad all staff, students and stakeholders showed strong resilience as we unite to ride through these difficult times.  I am confident that in 2022, we will grow from strength to strength and do all we can to bring back the full suite of educational programmes whilst keeping all our students and staff safe.


I would like to extend my congratulations to all the P6 graduates for their excellent achievement in the 2021 Primary School Leaving Examination (PSLE); and the pioneer batch to do so under the new AL level grading system.  The years of preparation for this change has ensured that our students are familiar with the benchmarks and standards.  Many of them performed up to their expectations and successfully progressed to secondary schools of their choice, including a growing number of students recognised for their strengths through Direct School Admission (DSA). The excellent results is a testament of the unwavering commitment given to our students by their teachers and parents. As an educator, I believe that instilling the love for learning that stays with the student throughout their lives is very important. Thus, I have confidence that the broad range of experiences that the school has provided for our graduates will help them discover more joy and develop intrinsic motivation in learning in their current schools and beyond.

<u>Ministry of Education (MOE) Kindergarten</u>

After years of construction and preparation (despite building challenges caused by Covid-19), MK@JWPS finally opened our gate to a new cohort of students and 12 exciting and experience MKEs.  Our MK provides MOE structured quality kindergarten education as well as Kcare service to the neighbouring children.  MK@JWPS not only adds greater vibrancy to the school environment with all the inquisitive children peppering the place, but also provides neighbourhood parents another choice for kindergarten education; one which is closely linked to the vibes of JWPS.  Surely, we will welcome our MK kids to join JWPS when they graduate from MK@JWPS.  

**Focus Areas**

In 2022 and beyond, the school is committed to provide a broad based, holistic education for the students, particularly focusing in 3 areas; Learn for Life, Embrace All Leaners and Enhance Student Well-being. 

1.    <u>Learn for Life</u>

Future-ready students will need to be equipped with both broad knowledge and practical skills. Hence, to help prepare our students to face the potential challenges of the future, we have put together learning packages for them. These packages are developed to help our students gain new knowledge, skills and values in both academic and non-academic areas. The packages include the _Academic Proficiency Package_, the _Life Skill Package_ and the _Leadership Development Package_. They are also aimed at realising the school vision of nurturing every JWPS student into becoming an engaged **_Learner_**, a reflective **_THInker_** and a selfless **_Leader_**. 

2.    <u>Embrace All Learners</u>

Our students have varying abilities and learning needs and we place great emphasis on embracing and developing every learner. To maximise their potential in learning and help them achieve competency and success in their own ways, we provide students with the _Baseline Support Package_, the _Special Educational Needs (SEN) Package_, the _‘Diversity in Strength’ Package_ and the _Lift-up Support Package_. Through these packages, we support all learners and motivate them to take ownership of their own learning. 

3.    <u>Enhance Student Well-being</u>

Student well-being is an important element in overall student success. With that in mind, the school generates a safe and positive learning environment that promotes nurturing the whole child, head, body and mind. Packages that focus on developing the students in the areas of physical, mental, social, emotional and moral are put in place. Such packages include the _Physical Well-being Package_, the _Social and Emotional Well-being Package_, the _Moral Well-being package_ and the _Talent Development Package_.

Apart from restoring normalcy of Teaching and Learning for all students in 2022 and working on the lost learning opportunities for students, JWPS is also focused on developing on 2 areas: 6-years Life Skill package and ALP in Climate Sustainability Education.  As we embarked on designing these 2 flagship programmes for our students, we are confident they will add a dimension of learning beyond what they can learn from curriculum subjects; much like those who had the opportunity to benefit from their involvement in BYOD (which we have expanded to 4 classes in P5 since 2021).  We also look forward to working closely with our stakeholders to help our students discover their strengths and interests, develop deep skills in the different aspects of development and achieve success. 

Wishing you a safe and rewarding 2022.

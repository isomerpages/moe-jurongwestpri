<p>The school recognises that it is important for our students to be equipped
with the necessary knowledge, skills and dispositions to navigate the complexities
of today’s fast-changing world through educating and enriching them holistically.
We aim to develop in our students an intrinsic motivation to learn and
acquire the 21st Century Competencies and values to thrive in the future.</p>
<p>To achieve this, the school provides our students with a holistic education
through a whole suite of programmes that support their cognitive development
(Cognitive Development Package), the acquisition of the 21CC (Life Skills
Package) and leadership development (Leadership Development Package). The
aims of these programmes are aligned to the school’s vision of nurturing
every JWPS student into becoming an engaged Learner, a reflective THInker
and a selfless Leader.</p>

<h3>P3 Project INNO &amp; P5 Young Environmental Enthusiasts (YEE)</h3>
<p>The P3 Project INNO in the English, Math, Science and Mother Tongue curricula
focus on inquiry-based learning projects. These projects are based on real-life
applications of key curricular concepts and create vibrant and enriching
learning experiences with problem-solving opportunities. It aims for the
students to take greater ownership of their own learning and for them to
become more engaged and creative in exploring new knowledge.</p>
<p>The P5 YEE learning platform is intended for the P5 students to deepen
their learning, discover new information and become independent learners.
Students are engaged in different activities during their English, Math,
Science and Mother Tongue lessons to explore issues and perspectives related
to environmental awareness. During their learning experiences, students
get the opportunities to synthesise knowledge from various areas of learning
and apply it to real-life situations.</p>
<p>As the students collaborate with their peers, reflect upon their learning
and communicate their ideas effectively, they exercise sound reasoning,
decision-making and metacognition. Students also take ownership of their
own learning as they are tasked to monitor their own learning and look
for new information to help them understand lessons better.</p>
<h3>Applied Learning Programme (ALP) - Green Living@JWPS</h3>
<p>The new ALP at JWPS focuses on environmental sustainability through character
development. Anchoring on the school’s vision, mission and values, ‘Green
Living @ JWPS’ aims to develop character and inculcate values of respect
and care for the environment as well as the needy. We aim to develop a
community of THinKERs, concerned citizens and confident learners who participate
actively in activities that lead to the resolution of environmental challenges,
make informed decisions and lead by example to be stewards of the environment.
Through meaningful, authentic, and engaging experiences, students will
develop 21st Century Competencies that will help them thrive in this diverse,
global and complex world.</p>
<h4>4 Key Areas – 4Cs</h4>
<p>Green Living @ JWPS is interdisciplinary in nature, involving 4 key areas
and focuses on getting students to apply their learning across subjects.
The use of real-world scenarios and problems encourages them to transfer
knowledge and skills acquired.</p>
<p><strong>Curriculum </strong>– Teaching and learning of sustainability
is embedded and enhanced within various subjects such as English Language,
Mathematics, Science, Mother Tongue Language, Art and CCE.</p>
<p><strong>Culture </strong>– Strengthening of eco-culture towards sustainability.
The right habits will be instilled in our students to encourage them to
champion a sustainability mindset.</p>
<p><strong>Community </strong>– Opportunities for students to venture and
collaborate beyond school. Strengthening of home-school partnership.</p>
<p><strong>Campus </strong>– Transforming the school into learning laboratories
for our students to see sustainability in action.</p>
<h4>3A Approach (Awareness, Action, and Attitude)</h4>
<p>The school adopts a <strong>3A</strong> approach in driving the ALP to instil
a broader mindset change and environmentally conscious habits.</p>
<p>In the <strong>Awareness </strong>phase, students will be equipped with
knowledge to deepen their understanding of environmental issues and the
need to love and protect the environment.</p>
<p>In the <strong>Action </strong>phase, students internalize the learning
through participating in school-curated hands-on tasks to help them apply
the knowledge they have acquired.</p>
<p>With the right <strong>Attitude </strong>instilled, students are empowered
to take on greater responsibility and accountability in improving environmental
sustainability.</p>

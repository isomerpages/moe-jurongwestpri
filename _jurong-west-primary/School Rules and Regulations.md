We will monitor students’ well-being and adopt the necessary mitigation measures to ensure their welfare, including stopping all outdoor activities, based on daily MOH Health Advisory. We request parents to inform us if your child has existing heart and lung conditions, such as asthma. Parents should also ensure that your child takes his/her medications and has these medications with him/ her according to his/her doctor’s instructions.  

  

### Infectious Diseases

If your child is down with chicken pox, H1N1 or Hand-Foot-Mouth disease, please take your doctor’s advice and let your child rest at home. As these diseases are highly infectious, please do not bring your child to school unless he/she has fully recovered.  

  

### Students' Medical Conditions

School will distribute a form for parents to update the medical conditions of their child each year.

CYBER WELLNESS @ JWPS

The school follows the following Cyber Wellness Framework which is adapted from the Ministry of Education (MOE).


Cyber Wellness @ JWPS is driven by two key principles: Respect for Self and Others and Safe and Responsible Use. It aims to equip all students with an awareness of the social, emotional and ethical impacts of the use of ICT. As part of the school's holistic approach in promoting cyber wellness, it is integrated into the formal curriculum, such as during Form Teacher Guidance Period (FTGP) lessons, Interdisciplinary Project Work (IPW) and other school-based programmes.

The structured FTGP lessons cover all six themes.

Primary 1	Computer Security
Primary 2	Netiquette and Danger of Cyber Contacts 
Primary 3	Cyber Bullying 
Primary 4	Copyright 
Primary 5	Handling Inappropriate Content
Primary 6	Gaming and Internet Addiction

These efforts as a whole comprehensively enable JWPS students to become safe and ethical harnessers of ICT.

Cyber Wellness @ JWPS is driven by two key principles: **Respect for Self and Others** and **Safe and Responsible Use**. It aims to equip all students with an awareness of the social, emotional and ethical impacts of the use of ICT. As part of the school's holistic approach in promoting cyber wellness, it is integrated into the formal curriculum, such as during Form Teacher Guidance Period (FTGP) lessons, Interdisciplinary Project Work (IPW) and other school-based programmes.

The structured FTGP lessons cover all six themes.

| -------- | -------- | 
| Primary 1 | Computer Security |

| Primary 3  |  Cyber Bullying |
| Primary 4  |  Copyright  |
| Primary 5  | Handling Inappropriate Content  |

These efforts as a whole comprehensively enable JWPS students to become safe and ethical harnessers of ICT.

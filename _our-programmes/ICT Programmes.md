At Jurong West Primary School, we aim to provide a technology-enriched school environment for teaching and learning for our students. The school adopts a responsive, agile approach and structure to help students react quickly to technological and contextual changes to ensure the effective use of Technology for a quality learning experience.<br>

We aim to nurture our students to be:<br>

* Self-directed learners who are intrinsically motivated to learn, take ownership of their own learning, manage and monitor their learning independently, explore and sustain their interest beyond curriculum.<br>

* Connected learners who continually learn by collaborating with their peers, the community and the world, connecting a range of online and offline information sources.<br>

* Digital learners who leverage technology for learning and can find, think, apply and digitally create, navigate space in a safe and responsible way.<br>

**Bring-Your-Own-Device Programme** (For Primary 5 and Primary 6 students)<br>


The school recognizes the need to prepare students for a rapidly changing world and started the Bring-Your-Own-Device Programme in 2020 with classes Enthusiastic 1 and Enthusiastic 2. This programme expanded to 8 classes in 2022 (Enthusiastic 1 to Enthusiastic 4, Resilience 1 to Resilience 4). <br>


Students will bring their personal laptop to school and learning can take place any time, anywhere, online and offline!  This enhances the learning experiences for our students as we carefully integrate technology into the curriculum.<br>

**Code For Fun Programme**


The Code For Fun Enrichment Programme aims to increase primary school students' knowledge of computational thinking, coding and making. The Code For Fun Enrichment Programme (offered jointly by IMDA and MOE) is offered to all MOE primary schools.<br>

In this programme, students learnt more about Computational thinking and how it can be applied to other aspects of their life.<br>

They are exposed to basic programming concepts such as events, loops, variables, and functions. This allows students to develop logical thinking and problem-solving skills by breaking down problems into bite-sizes.<br>

Students are also given the opportunity to carry out collaborative learning to program a dance using their Sphero robotic kits!<br>

Students ended off the 10-hour session with an introduction to Artificial Intelligence and Cyber Security.

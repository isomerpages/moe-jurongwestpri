CCAs are a key component of a balanced and holistic education where students can discover and explore their interest and talents in areas outside of the normal curriculum. In JWPS, CCAs are conducted outside of curriculum time over a period of 30 weeks.
Apart from bringing together students from different classes and profiles, the CCAs in JWPS serves as a platform for students to develop their characters and learn values and skills to become highly self-motivated, confident and well-balanced individuals. 
The soft skills and social-emotional competencies developed during CCAs sessions are essential in preparing students for the challenges they will face in the future.<br>

JWPS offers a total of 15 different CCAs, which can be grouped into 4 broad categories as listed below.

CCA sessions are held after school on either Mondays, Wednesdays and/or Fridays, from 2 p.m. to 4 p.m. The respective CCA Teachers-in-charge will provide more details via Parent Gateway app (PG).

**CCA Policy**

<br>
To ensure the progressive development of skill and knowledge in the CCA, students are expected to achieve at least 80% attendance in the year of participation. If a student misses a session, a medical certificate or a valid supporting document must be produced to explain the absence. Students who do not meet the minimum attendance will not be considered to have complete the CCA and their participation will not be recorded in their report card that year.<br>

Changing CCA is highly discouraged once your child has registered and has been accepted by a CCA. Students should only request for a change of CCA at the end of the year. This is to ensure greater skill development and continuity, as well as provide time and opportunities for students to build and deepen friendships within the CCA. As part of encouraging students to better manage their affairs and be responsible for their choices, we do not accept parent requests for changing of CCAs. 
The students are required to initiate the process themselves by speaking to both their current CCA teacher, as well as the teacher-in-charge of the CCA they wish to transfer to. Students have to complete a Request-for-Transfer (CCA) form which they can get from their current CCA teacher, and get approval from the teachers from both CCAs to initiate the transfer. Do note that the transfer applications would be considered on a case-to-case basis and success would be dependent if there is availability of space in the other CCA.

##### Lunar New Year Celebration and MT Fortnight Activities
<br>

Every year, JWPS welcomes the Lunar New Year with a series of fun-filled activities and a spectacular celebration in school. <br>

Teachers and students are charmed by the energetic stage performances like Wushu, Chinese Orchestra, acrobatic stunts, and many more. The highlight of this yearly event is the much anticipated performance by our very own JWPS Chinese Dance Club. <br>

Students also get to try their hands on a variety of classroom activities, like designing their own DIY Lunar New Year Cards and origami folding of the Zodiac Animal of the Year using red packets, so that they can send their sincere wishes to family and friends.<br>

In line with MT Fortnight, our school also organises many hands-on activities as part of the recess interlude. These carefully curated activities and cultural programmes aim to deepen our students' sense of belonging by understanding their social roles in their respective cultures and promote the learning of MT languages in a fun and engaging way.

##### Reading Mums
<br>
“Reading is the gateway skill that makes all other learning possible.”<br>
By Barack Obama<br>

Our Reading Mums Programme caters to P1 and P2 students who need the extra support to help them gain confidence in Chinese. <br>

Through reading of Chinese story books and the use of word cards, students get to enjoy listening to stories and reinforce their abilities in recognising Chinese characters. During the sessions, students also get to play word games, sing-along to Chinese songs and even dance to Chinese music! <br>

We are grateful to have the strong support of a group of enthusiastic parent support group volunteers to help us conduct these sessions so that students can get to experience the joy of learning Chinese Language in a fun way. Together, we hope to instil the joy of learning and also the love for reading Chinese books in our students.

##### DuDu Town
<br>
We strongly believe that reading enriches lives. Reading also helps to improve our language abilities and fluency, allowing us to convey our thoughts and ideas more effectively. Thus, in order to stimulate students’ interest in reading Chinese story books, Dudu accounts have been created for all P1 to P6 students to make reading more accessible. <br>

Besides online story books, students can even use this platform to personalise their own vocabulary lists, play games and attempt quizzes to reinforce their learning. Students can also read eBooks as recommended by their teachers during their leisure time. To encourage students to read more, the school rewards avid readers with prizes monthly and the top readers yearly.<br>

We hope our students can pick up the love for reading during their 6 years education journey in JWPS.<br>


##### Competitions
<br>
Our students are given opportunities to participate in various internal and external competitions such as calligraphy, writing competitions, video production and online quizzes. These competitions provide the platforms for our students to showcase their talents, gain confidence and interest in learning the language and also display our school’s THInKER values. <br>

For the past few years, our students have been actively participating in many well-established competitions such as the International Chinese Language (ICLC), National Chinese Challenge, National Memory Games Challenge, National Picture-book Creation and Cluster Chinese Calligraphy Competition.  They have achieved a number of awards and recognitions from these experiences and have learned to interact and make friends with their peers from other schools.

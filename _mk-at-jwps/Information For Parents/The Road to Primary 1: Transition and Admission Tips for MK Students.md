<h4>Primary 1 Admission for MK Students</h4>
<p>SC and PR children from the MK are eligible to register under Phase 2A
during the Primary 1 Registration Exercise for admission to the respective
primary school their MK is located within. However, admission is&nbsp;<strong>not guaranteed&nbsp;</strong>as
balloting will be conducted when the number of applicants in Phase 2A exceeds
the school vacancies.

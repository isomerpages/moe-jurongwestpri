For P1 registration, MK students will be under phase 2A.

Depending on the availability of P1 vacancies during phase 2A, your child may or may not be admitted to Jurong West Primary School (JWPS). 
<br>  
There is no guarantee that your child will be admitted to JWPS under phase 2A. If your child is unsuccessful under phase 2A, you can apply under phase 2C.

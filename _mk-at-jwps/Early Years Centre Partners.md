<h3>Early Years Centre (EYC) Partnership</h3>
<p>Under this partnership, eligible children in the EYCs are guaranteed a
place at a partner MOE Kindergarten (MK). You can choose to enrol at the
partner MK for their Kindergarten 1 (K1) and Kindergarten 2 (K2) programme.
This allows your child to have a seamless transition to K1 in the year
they turn 5.</p>

are enrolled in these 2 centres will be offered a K1 place in MK@Jurong

<h4>Learning at MK@JW</h4>
<p>Our curriculum is anchored on two flagship programmes:</p>
<p>📖 <strong>HI-Light Programme</strong> – supporting children’s holistic
development through integrated and active learning</p>
<p>📖 <strong>Starlight Literacy Programme</strong> – nurturing bilingualism
in English and Mother Tongue Languages (Chinese, Malay, or Tamil) Each
school term also culminates in a Weeks of Wonder (WOW) project, where children
explore, inquire, and apply their learning through meaningful, hands-on
experiences.</p>

From script-writing to oratory skills to prop-making, members will draw on the experience of others and tap on vivid imagination to prepare and perform skits. Not only will members be able to explore literary interests and tune in to the wonderful world of music and lyrics, they will also be presented with opportunities to work collaboratively, develop leadership skills as well as hone socio-emotional competencies.</p><p><br></p><p>CCA Day: Monday</p>

Our Hockey CCA comprises of the CCA team and the school team. Our CCA team is made up of Primary 3 to 6 students who have the interest to try hockey and the passion to pursue it. The school team comprises of students who are selected based on their skills and character, to represent the school in competitions. At present, we are looking for both boys and girls to join our team.

The training sessions provide members the opportunity to achieve their true potential and develop their character. Hockey CCA activities include daily morning practice sessions for the passionate players, weekly training sessions (parents can opt to have your child attend one or two sessions a week) and the Inter-Primary Hockey tournament.

The students will be trained by a very dedicated coach, Miss Luo Yingying, who is a former PE teacher and SEA Games medalist.

Under Coach Yingying and Mr Lau Ban Hwee’s tutelage, our team has continued to do us proud at national interschool games.

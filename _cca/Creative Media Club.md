<p><strong>Introducing Our New Creative Media Club in 2025</strong>
</p>
<p>We are excited to announce the launch of our new Creative Media Club,
a fantastic opportunity for our students to explore their creative talents
and learn new digital skills! The club is designed to spark curiosity and
imagination, offering a range of exciting activities in digital art, 3D
animations, robotics, photography, and videography.</p>
<p><strong>Digital Art</strong>
<br>Students will dive into the world of digital painting and design to create
interesting visuals. They will explore various techniques that blend creativity
with technology.</p>
<p><strong>3D Animations</strong>
<br>In our 3D animation sessions, students will learn how to bring their ideas
to life! They will create their own characters, and use animation techniques
to make their creations move, giving them a glimpse into the world of animated
films and games.</p>
<p><strong>Robotics</strong>
<br>Robotics enthusiasts will get hands-on experience coding and completing
projects. They will be problem-solving and learning coding skills to complete
fun and challenging tasks.</p>
<p><strong>Photography and Videography</strong>
<br>For those who love capturing moments, our photography and videography
sessions will teach students the basics of camera handling, composition,
and editing. They will learn how to create compelling stories through images
and videos, showcasing their unique perspectives and creativity.</p>
<p>We believe the Creative Media Club will inspire our students to think
outside the box, nurture their talents, and prepare them for a future where
creativity and technology go hand in hand.</p>

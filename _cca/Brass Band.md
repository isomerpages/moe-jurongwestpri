<p>At Jurong West Primary School, our Band provides opportunities for budding
musicians to develop their musical talents and grow in confidence. Members
learn the fundamentals of musicianship, including proper posture, instrument
handling, and performing as part of a cohesive ensemble.</p>
<p>Our band members are passionate about music and committed to regular practice.
Their musical journey is enriched through exchange programmes with other
primary and secondary school bands, as well as performances at school and
public events.</p>
<p>Beyond music, our structured routines instil important values such as
discipline, teamwork, responsibility, and commitment. Leadership is also
nurtured as students are empowered to lead sectionals, plan performances,
and participate in key events such as the Singapore Youth Festival (SYF),
school concerts, and exchange programmes.</p>

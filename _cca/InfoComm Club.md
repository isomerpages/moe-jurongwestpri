ICC uses computers as tools to enhance students' cognitive development. While learning these skills and competencies for themselves, our members exercise and hone those skills by assisting in various school events throughout the year. <br></p><p>The ICC also aims to promote photography as an art form and to raise awareness of photography in the school. It is also a Club for students to share their work and get feedback. The ICC hopes to foster creativity and camaraderie among its members. <br></p><p>CCA Day: Monday</p>

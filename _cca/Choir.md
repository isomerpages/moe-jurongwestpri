The club actively trains our students to learn and appreciate a wide range of musical genres within choral literature. We also provide opportunities for social interaction between schools as exchange programs to promote growth and broaden their horizons. There is an emphasis on teamwork and discipline as the members prepares for various performances and competition. Hence, our members actively contribute to the musical culture in school to develop musicianship, showmanship, confidence to express themselves, and poise.</p><p><br></p><p>Events: <br></p><ul><li><p>Singapore Youth Festival (SYF)</p></li><li><p>Singapore International Choral Festival (SICF)</p></li><li><p>School performances</p></li><li><p>Exchange programmes</p></li><li><p>Leadership Opportunities</p></li></ul><p><br></p><p>Training Day: Wednesday</p>

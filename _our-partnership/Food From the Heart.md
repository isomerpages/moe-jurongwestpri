We have partnered Food From the Heart (FTTH) since 2018.

The School Goodie Bag programme by FTTH focuses on providing underprivileged primary and secondary school students and their families with food rations to support them through a key stage of their lives.

The programme supplements the meals of needy children and their families and reduces their financial burden. 

Each month, food items from FTTH are delivered to the school and distributed by the school to 50 underprivileged families.

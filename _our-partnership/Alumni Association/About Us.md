The Jurong West Primary School Alumni Association (JWPSAA) was formed on 3rd August 2018 in conjunction with the school’s 20th Anniversary celebrations. It serves as a platform for our ex-students to stay connected with each other and contribute back to our alma mater. **Join us****[\[SHY1\]](#_msocom_1)**&nbsp; and be part of our JWPSAA family today!
